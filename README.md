## hi
Average teenager with interest to programming.
im very *ntroverted*. pls forgive me especially at issues and PRs

used distro :
- current main : nixos ('24~)
- openSUSE ('24)
- void linux ('24)
- main pcs os : nixos ('23)
- arch ('22)
- the previous one : fedora ('18)
- the first one : ubuntu('16,'17)

why are you guys following me?? All of my projects are private repo?? But thanks, I might start making it public once I'm confident that my code isn't a total garbage.
